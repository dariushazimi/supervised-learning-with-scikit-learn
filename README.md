# Supervised Learning with scikit-learn

## Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data and when there are no labeled data, we call it unsupervised learning.

### **Supervised learning**

In supervised learning we have Predictor variables / features and a target variable.

Goal: Predict the target variable, given the predictor variables.

| **Task type** | **Target variable** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Classification | is categorical \(spam or legit\) |
| Regression | is continuous \(like price of houses\) |

### **Unsupervised learning**

Uncovering hidden patterns from unlabeled data.

* Grouping customers into distinct categories \(clustering\) based on their purchasing behavior without knowing in advance what these categories maybe. This is known as clustering \(just of the branches of unsupervised learning\)

### **Reinforcement learning**

This is where machines interact with an environment. These reinforcement learning agents can optimize their behavior based on a given system of rewards and punishments. Similar to what google GO project was able to achieve playing GO.

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
